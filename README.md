## memlib

### This project is in an immature state.  Use at your own risk.

A generic memory hacking library written in Odin with performance as a primary concern.  Currently featuring various robust tools for pattern scanning and x86/x86_64 disassembling.  More features are planned for the future, as is documentation.
